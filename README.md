**Intelligent Beach Cleaning Robot**

In our final year project, we are developing a prototype intelligent beach cleaning robot with dual mode refuse collection for efficient cleaning. 
We are implementing advanced object detection for identifying and targeting plastics on the beach. 
Our robot is equipped with autonomous navigation, utilizing two distinct path planning algorithms for adaptability to various terrains such. 
This project showcases our skills in robotics, computer vision, and autonomous systems.
My contribution: Designed the refuse collection system using Solid Works, built the prototype robot, implemented embedded system control, and developed autonomous navigation algorithms for efficient beach cleaning.
